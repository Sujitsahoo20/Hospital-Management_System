# Hospital-Management_System

Introduction

As we are aware of Covid-19 pandemic situations, we have seen that there were many difficulties in treatment of
patients so we have an idea of automating the functionality of hospitals like fixing an appointment , adding doctor details ,
adding patient details. Our project follows the guidelines approved by the government like maintaining social distancing and there
would be no physical contact between doctor, patients and hospital staff thus decreasing the chances of outbreak.

COVID-2019 was first appeared in the city of Wuhan China in December 2020 and then spread into
whole world. The China has applied methodology for its control and within two month
controlled the trend of corona virus in China. India also managed the outbreak very efficiently and set up an example for other
countries. Lockdown in India was imposed on 24th March 2020 which helped to control the outbreak of virus upto some extent.
Strict guidelines were imposed by government of India to maintain the protocols like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing,
imposing lockdown in states. The main objective of “Covid-19 Hospital Management System” is to automate the daily
operations of hospitals. Specially in the disastrous situations such as pandemics like Covid-19. During the outbreak of Covid-19
many powerful and well-developed countries like USA, Russia, France also faced many problems in terms of management of
patients and their needs. Covid-19 Hospital Management System is an integrated hospital information system, which addresses all
the major functional areas of multi-speciality hospitals. The Covid-19 Hospital Management enables better patient , patient safety,
patient confidentiality, efficiency, reduced costs and better management information system.


WHAT IS PANDEMIC?

A Pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new and deadly disease. Viral respiratory diseases , such as those caused by a new
influence virus or the coronavirus COVID-19 , are the most likely to turn into a pandemic. A pandemic is a disease that spreads
across countries or continents. It affects more people and takes more lives. The World Health Organization(WHO) declared
COVID-19 to be a pandemic when it became clear that the illness was severe and that it was spreading quickly over a wide area.

TECHNOLOGY USED

HTML : HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is used for designing the structure of a Web
page. HTML consists of a series of elements called as tags. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the
content.[3]HTML defines the structure of a web page and it is the first thing that a user interacts with. HTML has
many components which we called as tags like heading tag from h1 to h6, paragraph tag(<p> paragraph </p>), image
tag, anchor tag etc.

CSS : CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of
making web pages presentable. It is used to make our webpage more attractive and user friendly
Some of the key advantages of learning CSS:

I. Create Stunning Web site - CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can design
the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what
background images or colors are used, layout designs, variations in display for different devices and screen sizes
as well as a variety of other effects.[4]

II. Control web - CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of
an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.[4]

III. Learn other languages - Once you understands the basic of HTML and CSS then other related
technologies like javascript, php, or angular are become easier to understand

PHP: PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.[16] PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.

PROPOSED WORK

We have proposed a management model having three main roles-:
1. ADMIN
2. DOCTOR
3. PATIENT

All the three modules have various sub-modules defining their functionalities:

ADMIN:
Admin have sub-modules defining its functionality like first page of admin has options of signup and login and then after
logging in , the admin can manage doctor and patient details , approve doctor and patient appointment. Admin plays the
main role in this project and manages the whole functionality of hospital.

DOCTOR:
Doctor have sub-modules defining its functionality like first page of doctor has options of signup and login and then after
logging in , the doctor can view and delete patient appointment, can view patient details, can view appointments ,patient
under him or her.

PATIENT:
Patient have sub-modules defining its functionality like first page of patient has options of signup and login and then after
logging in , the patient can view and book appointment, can view doctor’s details.
